# CGames

This is a collection of basic games written in C and using Raylib.

## Completed Games

No games have been completed yet.

## Planned Games

I plan to create the following games.

- Pong
- Snake
- Tetris

This list will expand as I develop more of them.

## Build

Currently, this build is for Linux only.

First, you will need to have Raylib installed on your system.

This project uses a Makefile to build the program. Run the following command
to build and start the program.

```bash
make build && ./bin/main
```
